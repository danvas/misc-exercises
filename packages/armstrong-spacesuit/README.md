# Luma AI: Design Engineering Challenge
Create a desktop landing page to showcase a 3D model 

You can use any model you like but if you have nothing in mind then use Damaged Helmet

The text content of the page doesn’t matter, feel free to use Lorem Ipsum or go wild with made-up product details!

This project has wide scope with a range of possible outcomes, the outcomes build on each other giving you scope to implement more features should you like. Don’t worry if you don’t complete all features!



### Outcome 1
Page embedding a real-time 3D model alongside text describing, model can be interactive

### Outcome 2
Page embedding a 3D model with multiple sections, 3D model is shown from different angles in each section

### Outcome 3
As the user scrolls between sections, the 3D model rotates to show a different part

The same 3D model is persisted as the user scrolls between sections

### Outcome 4
Model rotates smoothly between sections and smoothly rotates back when scrolling up, always showing the expected side for each section

The user can interact with the model and it returns to its showcase position when the user finishes
